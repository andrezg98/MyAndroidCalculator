This repository contains the code implemented to develop a calculator as a mobile application.

To start using the application, please note the following points:

## 🔃 **Vertical Mode**
In this view you may work with the basic buttons of a calculator. ⚠️ Please, pay special attention to the **use** of some of them:
  - `M+` → **MEMORY ADD**: Adds the number displayed on the screen to the memory but does not display the sum of these numbers.
           _Number_ → `M+`
  - `MR` → **MEMORY RECALL**: Recalls the number stored in memory. The number remains in memory.
  - `CE` → **CLEAR ELEMENT**: Deletes the last number inserted.
  - `C` → **CLEAR**: Deletes the entire current calculation. Does not delete the number stored in memory.
  ---
  - `^` → **POWER**: _firstNumber_ `^` _secondNumber_ `=`
  - `+` → **ADD**: _firstNumber_ `+` _secondNumber_ `=`
  - `-` → **SUBTRACT**: _firstNumber_ `-` _secondNumber_ `=`
  - `÷` → **DIVIDE**: _firstNumber_ `÷` _secondNumber_ `=`
  - `×` → **MULTIPLY**: _firstNumber_ `×` _secondNumber_ `=`
  - `√` → **SQUARE ROOT**: `√` _Number_ `=`
  - `%` → **PERCENT**: _Number_ → `%`
  - `+/-` → **SIGN CHANGE**: _Number_ → `+/-`
## 🔁 **Landscape Mode**

           _Number_ → `M-`
  ---
  - `1/x` → **INVERT**: _Number_ → `1/x`
  - `x²` → **SQUARED**: _Number_ → `x²`
  - `Π` → **PI**: _Number_ `Π`
  - `SIN` → **SIN**: `SIN` _Number_ `=`
  - `COS` → **COS**: `COS` _Number_ `=`
  - `TAN` → **TAN**: `TAN` _Number_ `=`
